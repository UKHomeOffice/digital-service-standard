# **Digital Service Standard Team monthly update: August 2017**

**Who we are and what we do**

The Digital Service Standard Team are in the Product Design Centre of Excellence. We support teams to meet the [digital service standard](https://www.gov.uk/service-manual/service-standard), and co-ordinate assurance to show our teams are meeting the standard. We work with professional communities, delivery portfolios, governance colleagues, GDS and others. 

Get in touch if you have feedback on the digital service standard, want to know more about the process – or if you are a performance analyst and not already in touch with colleagues

## What we did in August

### Health checks and assessments 
- An internal alpha assessment on Proving Things
- An internal alpha assessment on Reporting Offender Management 

### Training and capability
- Our Digital Service Standard Manager, Alex, has now moved to GDS. She will be missed, and we wish her all the best in her new role
- We delivered the next iteration of our digital service standard assessor training in August, again jointly with GDS. We have welcomed 7 new assessors to the community. Everyone who filled in the feedback form would recommend the training, so get in touch if you want to join them

### Iterations and general updates
- We are continuing to work with the wider Centre of Excellence on reviewing the governance process. This includes linking up with other governance, both in the HO and beyond, such as the new Cabinet Office spend controls process

## What we are going to do in September 
- We have assessments and health checks planned for a number of teams. We are booking in sessions as far ahead as November, so please let us know early if you want an assessment or health check
- We are also focussing on ensuring the data we capture about assessments and assessors is accurate. We will include some figures in next month’s report, when we have completed this exercise
- We will have a performance analyst, Arslan, spending half of his time with us to work for the Centre of Excellence. If you have a performance analyst in your team who is not already in touch with Arslan, please get in touch to help us build up the Home Office community
- Arslan is also holding a session with product managers in September on performance analytics 
- We will be working on the next phase of the governance work. 

We are still working on the format of this update, and will iterate it. Let us know if you have any feedback.
