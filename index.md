# **Digital Service Standard Team monthly update: September 2017**

**Who we are and what we do**

The Digital Service Standard Team are in the Product Design Centre of Excellence. We support teams to meet the [digital service standard](https://www.gov.uk/service-manual/service-standard), and co-ordinate assurance to show our teams are meeting the standard. We work with professional communities, delivery portfolios, governance colleagues, GDS and others. 

Get in touch if you have feedback on the digital service standard, want to know more about the process – or if you are a performance analyst and not already in touch with colleagues

## What we did in September

### Health checks and assessments 
- An internal alpha assessment on GLAA
- A mock assessment, prior to a GDS alpha assessment

### Performance Analytics workshops
- UKVI services on gov.uk
- Immigration status
- RMP
- ROTM

### Training and capability
- Our fast streamer, Tommy, has moved on to his next posting. We wish him the best. His replacement, Natasha, starts on 9th October and will be here for 6 months. 
- We are in the process of advertising – initially for a Digital Service Standard Manager. The advert is on civil service jobs
- Arslan, our performance analyst, attended the product managers meet-up, and spoke to them about measuring performance and the use of analytics 

### Iterations and general updates
- We are continuing to work with the wider Centre of Excellence on reviewing the governance process. This includes linking up with other governance, both in the HO and beyond, such as the new Cabinet Office spend controls process

## What we are going to do in October 
- We are continuing with the items above. 
- We are also booking in assessments and health checks. If you need one, please get in touch early so we can agree a suitable slot with you
